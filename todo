Perhaps
☐ A sample twitter application to showcase how schema can be composed together


A list of things to do for the generator

☐ generateModels - break down the schema config into a collection name map of models
☐ Need a way to recognise the distinct types of each prop that's passed in. I.e what's the semantic meaning behind a string (either as part of the configuration)
☐ Support for one-to-one relationships with document references
☐ Support for many to many relationships with document reference

More advanced
☐ Support references between models in generated data
☐ Explore a class based prop creation option
